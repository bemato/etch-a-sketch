# etch-a-sketch

This is a project that was made as part of the Odin Project. It is a sketch pad 
that is built using javascript.

The sketchpad has tiny div containers that change their background color when the mouse hovers over them. 

The colors change randomly (increasing in black 10% everytime) until on the 10th hover they acheive a full black. Also their is the ability to resize the grid.
